ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m @nonicrook.
- ðŸ‘€ I am a career changer who left the legal field and entered the world of tech at the age of 50!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Junior Engineer with an amazing small company doing big things for little people.
- My skills include Java, JUnit Testing, Spring framework, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and some Vue.js.
- My toolkit includes VS Code, IntelliJ, PGAdmin, Valentina, Postman, Jira and GitLab.
- Since getting hired, I'm learning Git branching and Docker along with a deeper understanding of VS Code extensions.


Welcome to my personal project!
My brother owns a motorcycle towing business. My goal is to build a commercial/e-commerce website for his business and merchandise, and eventually include a tow scheduling/dispatch application.
I am so appreciative of the contributions, guidance, tips and coding resources I have received from my friends in tech. 
Thank you all!
